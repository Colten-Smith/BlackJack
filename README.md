# BlackJack
This project is a remake of a previous project I made in Python that I unfortunately lost. I started the project as a practice for creating objects that were designed to 
be reuseable in later projects, but over time I began to add more features. It works like a regular game of blackjack, where you try to get a higher hand value than the 
dealer, but with some additional features.
  -ASCII art of cards
  -Chip betting mechanics
  -Intuitive UI
  -Local High Score Leaderboard
